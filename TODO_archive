#+TODO: TODO(t) WAIT(w@/!) | DONE(d!) CANCELED(c@)

* Introduction

This is an integrated TODO list for the FreedomBox project, compiling todos from
each of the included projects.  This list includes all the completed or canceled
items, to avoid cluttering up the active TODO list with irrelevant noise.

Specifically, it includes third-level headlines that are complete.  It doesn't go
any deeper, because those start including subtasks which are often dependent on
one another for context.

  Also unnecessary since Plinth.

This will be the user's crash course to their freedombox.

  That can be removed altogether, it presumes unlikely service config.

#+begin_ascii
  The tracker URL in the torrent file uses UDP, which is not universally
  supported in Debian (bug #638194).

*** DONE Make Plinth Launch on Startup

- Make plinth in FM during image build process, or,

- Build some giant startup script to run Plinth that handles everything:

  - make-ing plinth
  - other requirements

Plinth's own start.sh should handle its own local installation, nothing else.
The big script should probably assume ~/exmachina is available.

*** DONE Add RaspberryPi target

Not every device supports external storage anyway...  Just use a bigger card.

The VBox image and filesystem image have completely separate dependency lists.
That is bad.  Both images should pull in the same list of dependencies to make
sure they're functionally equivalent.

We'll need to parse the single dependency list for each image separately and
pass those to the dependency-getter (apt-get in one case, --package in the
other).  Unifying other pieces is also nice, but this is the most important.

  Unnecessary after move to vmdebootstrap.

Parted's really useful.  This means we can forego using a USB device and not
need to mess with /etc/fstab at all.

  Fixing dependency duplication for FBuddy specifically is worth less
  than moving to .debs, and will break FBuddy for non-FBX installs,
  anyway.

This'll help unify the dependencies at the file level.

Might not be worth it, as everything's moving to .debs soon.

** Infrastructure [1/1]

*** DONE Fix DreamPlug MAC Addresses
CLOSED: [2014-01-30 Thu 21:54]
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2014-01-30 Thu 21:54]

Reflashing the DreamPlug's bootloader erases the interface MAC addresses.  We
should either save the MAC addresses or re-generate correct MAC addresses for
the DreamPlug.

If you're affected by this issue, you'll see these errors:

#+begin_example

  All rights reserved.
  For info, please visit https://www.isc.org/software/dhcp/

  send_packet: Network is down
  dhclient.c:1909: Failed to send 300 byte long packet over eth1 interface.
  receive_packet failed on eth1: Network is down

#+end_example

The key indicator of this error is seeing this line when running ~ifup~:

: receive_packet failed on eth1: Network is down

To correct this, we'll need to set the MAC address for each of the available
interfaces.  The most obvious way to do this is probably through adding a line
to each interface's stanza in ~/etc/network/interfaces~ that sets the MAC
address:

: hwaddress ether 00:00:00:00:00:01

Or, we can just use something like ~macchanger~:

: macchanger -a eth1

Or, since macchanger has no knowledge of ~/etc/network/interfaces~, we can just
add random data ourselves.

*** DONE Add HSTS
CLOSED: [2013-12-08 Sun 11:55]
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-12-08 Sun 11:55]

If we can configure HSTS on the first-boot, we should be able to better control
some MITM attacks, because the client will refuse to load Plinth without HTTPS.
Of course, this only works if the user uses the same client device over time,
but not providing this protection is stupid.

*** DONE Make =actions= asynchronous
CLOSED: [2013-12-08 Sun 11:53]
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-12-08 Sun 11:53]

Actions (the action scripts in the /actions directory) are currently
synchronous, in that Plinth will wait until the action completes to return a
response.  That's terrible for long running actions, and especially actions that
take longer than the HTTP request's TTL, as user is brought to an error page
even though the action is still ongoing.  Make actions asynchronous and alert
the user when the action completes.

*** DONE Remove old user configuration
CLOSED: [2013-12-08 Sun 11:51]
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-12-08 Sun 11:51]

Since we switched to bcrypt for password storage and since we fixed the user
creation process, there's no point to keeping the old users database around.
So, remove it before it's used inappropriately.

We currently post on login fails.

Now irrelevant, as Plinth is behind HTTPS, but still fixed, anyway.

*** DONE CherryPy HTTPRedirects Shouldn't Go To 127.0.0.1

- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-09-29 Sun 18:15]

They shouldn't change the server's name.

Fixed by putting CherryPy behind Apache.

The VM will be pre-configured to make development and testing straightforward.

Basically, this is a standard image with the desktop task selected.

Now easy, with this build command:

: CUSTOMIZE="development" make virtualbox-image
