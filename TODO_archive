#+TODO: TODO(t) WAIT(w@/!) | DONE(d!) CANCELED(c@)

* Introduction

This is an integrated TODO list for the FreedomBox project, compiling todos from
each of the included projects.  This list includes all the completed or canceled
items, to avoid cluttering up the active TODO list with irrelevant noise.

Specifically, it includes third-level headlines that are complete.  It doesn't go
any deeper, because those start including subtasks which are often dependent on
one another for context.


* FreedomBox 1.0

** FreedomBuddy [2/2]

*** DONE Finish FreedomBuddy UI
CLOSED: [2013-07-28 Sun 14:12]
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-07-28 Sun 14:12]

*** CANCELED Move ./build dependencies to ../

  Fixing dependency duplication for FBuddy specifically is worth less
  than moving to .debs, and will break FBuddy for non-FBX installs,
  anyway.

This'll help unify the dependencies at the file level.

Might not be worth it, as everything's moving to .debs soon.

** Freedom Maker [10/10]

*** DONE Create target specific /etc/network/interfaces
CLOSED: [2014-01-29 Wed 21:07]
- State "DONE" from "TODO" [2014-01-29 Wed 21:07]

*** CANCELED Update the login message to mention passwords and intro file.
CLOSED: [2014-01-29 Wed 21:10]
- State "CANCELED" from "TODO" [2014-01-29 Wed 21:10] \\
  Unnecessary now that the Plinth UI is available on first boot.

*** CANCELED Write an intro file so users can =less hello=
CLOSED: [2014-01-29 Wed 21:10]
- State "CANCELED"   from "TODO"       [2014-01-29 Wed 21:10] \\
  Also unnecessary since Plinth.

This will be the user's crash course to their freedombox.

*** CANCELED Add tcp torrent tracker for built images
CLOSED: [2014-01-29 Wed 21:10]
- State "CANCELED"   from "TODO"       [2014-01-29 Wed 21:10] \\
  That can be removed altogether, it presumes unlikely service config.

#+begin_ascii
  The tracker URL in the torrent file uses UDP, which is not universally
  supported in Debian (bug #638194).
#+end_ascii

*** DONE Make Plinth Launch on Startup
CLOSED: [2013-11-10 Sun 14:36]
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-11-10 Sun 14:36]

- Make plinth in FM during image build process, or,

- Build some giant startup script to run Plinth that handles everything:

  - make-ing plinth
  - other requirements

Plinth's own start.sh should handle its own local installation, nothing else.
The big script should probably assume ~/exmachina is available.

*** DONE Add RaspberryPi target
CLOSED: [2013-11-10 Sun 14:28]
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-11-10 Sun 14:28]

*** DONE Merge Freedom Maker Shiny into Master

*** CANCELED Move /var and /home to external SD card?
CLOSED: [2013-07-27 Sat 20:53]
- State "CANCELED"   from "TODO"       [2013-07-27 Sat 20:53]

Not every device supports external storage anyway...  Just use a bigger card.

*** DONE Unify VirtualBox and Image Build Systems
CLOSED: [2013-12-08 Sun 09:33]
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-12-08 Sun 09:33]

The VBox image and filesystem image have completely separate dependency lists.
That is bad.  Both images should pull in the same list of dependencies to make
sure they're functionally equivalent.

We'll need to parse the single dependency list for each image separately and
pass those to the dependency-getter (apt-get in one case, --package in the
other).  Unifying other pieces is also nice, but this is the most important.

*** DONE Improve USB Formatting [2/2]
CLOSED: [2013-12-08 Sun 09:34]
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-12-08 Sun 09:34]

**** CANCELED Add usb formatting to FM's README
CLOSED: [2013-07-27 Sat 20:31]
- State "CANCELED"   from "TODO"       [2013-07-27 Sat 20:31] \\
  If parted handles the image, we can simplify formatting a lot.

**** DONE Move from USB image to .img with parted.
CLOSED: [2013-12-08 Sun 09:33]
- State "DONE"       from "CANCELED"   [2014-01-29 Wed 21:12] \\
  Fixed with move to vmdebootstrap.
- State "CANCELED"   from "TODO"       [2013-12-08 Sun 09:33] \\
  Unnecessary after move to vmdebootstrap.

Parted's really useful.  This means we can forego using a USB device and not
need to mess with /etc/fstab at all.

** Plinth [9/9]
CLOSED: [2014-01-29 Wed 22:25]
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2014-01-29 Wed 22:25]

*** DONE Add HSTS
CLOSED: [2013-12-08 Sun 11:55]
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-12-08 Sun 11:55]

If we can configure HSTS on the first-boot, we should be able to better control
some MITM attacks, because the client will refuse to load Plinth without HTTPS.
Of course, this only works if the user uses the same client device over time,
but not providing this protection is stupid.

*** DONE Make =actions= asynchronous
CLOSED: [2013-12-08 Sun 11:53]
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-12-08 Sun 11:53]

Actions (the action scripts in the /actions directory) are currently
synchronous, in that Plinth will wait until the action completes to return a
response.  That's terrible for long running actions, and especially actions that
take longer than the HTTP request's TTL, as user is brought to an error page
even though the action is still ongoing.  Make actions asynchronous and alert
the user when the action completes.

*** DONE Remove old user configuration
CLOSED: [2013-12-08 Sun 11:51]
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-12-08 Sun 11:51]

Since we switched to bcrypt for password storage and since we fixed the user
creation process, there's no point to keeping the old users database around.
So, remove it before it's used inappropriately.

*** DONE Provide CherryPy through Apache
CLOSED: [2013-09-29 Sun 18:14]
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-09-29 Sun 18:14]

*** DONE Don't POST password... EVER.
CLOSED: [2013-09-29 Sun 18:14]
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-09-29 Sun 18:14]

We currently post on login fails.

Now irrelevant, as Plinth is behind HTTPS, but still fixed, anyway.

*** DONE CherryPy HTTPRedirects Shouldn't Go To 127.0.0.1
CLOSED: [2013-09-29 Sun 18:15]
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-09-29 Sun 18:15]

They shouldn't change the server's name.

Fixed by putting CherryPy behind Apache.

*** DONE Include missing dependencies. [4/4]

Do it for consistency with freedombox-privoxy and freedom-maker.
