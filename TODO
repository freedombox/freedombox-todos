* FreedomBox 1.0 [1/7]

  A dedicated hacker's release.  All the pieces are there, but not necessarily
  integrated as well as they should be.

** TODO Infrastructure [0/1]

*** TODO Start Gluing Pieces Together

    At least some projects should work with Plinth and use the LDAP backend.

** DONE Key Report [1/1]
   CLOSED: [2013-08-01 Thu 22:13]
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-08-01 Thu 22:13]

*** DONE Create Key/Cert Expiry Reporting Tools
    CLOSED: [2013-08-01 Thu 22:13]
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-08-01 Thu 22:13]

    [[file:key-report/key-report.py]]

** TODO FreedomBuddy [2/5]

*** TODO Finish Basic FreedomBuddy Functionality [0/2]

**** TODO Finish Introduction System

     1. Sender exports public key to file.
     2. Sender exports signed location message to file.
     3. Sender archives both files.
     4. Sender and receiver exchange the archive.
     5. Receiver unpacks the archive.
     6. Receiver imports public key.
     7. Receiver verifies and imports signed location message.

**** TODO Add Default Services [0/3]

     Make a default set of services available to make it easy for folks to start
     hosting services for someone else.  It could be a sort of "add a new user"
     wizard that sets the default services and creates the introduction message
     archive.

     We need to create a "default" key that is loaded into the shelf only when
     the shelf doesn't already contain a default service set.  That service set
     should contain the current default services:

     - http listener
     - http sender
     - http monitor
     - cli monitor

***** TODO Load Default Services

      If default services aren't found in the saved data, they're read from the
      config file.

***** TODO Reject "Default" Key Updates

      The "Default" key is a special, protected, key (maybe 0, maybe "default")
      for which all external service updates are rejected, in the same way the
      "-update-time" service suffix is protected.

***** TODO Copy Default Services when Adding a New Key

      The services you want to host for other people are copied to their service
      list whenever a new key is added.

*** TODO Write FreedomBuddy Threat Model
    :PROPERTIES:
    :Attachments: fbuddy-threat-model
    :ID:       fc7e9d5e-7db7-4b7c-9efa-f5ca23d0eff5

    - [[file:data/fc/7e9d5e-7db7-4b7c-9efa-f5ca23d0eff5/fbuddy-threat-model.org][FreedomBuddy Threat Model]]

*** TODO Add Contracts to functions.

    Use PyContract to verify functional contracts.

*** DONE Finish FreedomBuddy UI
    CLOSED: [2013-07-28 Sun 14:12]
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-07-28 Sun 14:12]

*** CANCELED Move ./build dependencies to ../
    CLOSED: [2013-07-28 Sun 14:12]
    - State "CANCELED"   from "TODO"       [2013-07-28 Sun 14:12] \\
      Fixing dependency duplication for FBuddy specifically is worth less
      than moving to .debs, and will break FBuddy for non-FBX installs,
      anyway.

    This'll help unify the dependencies at the file level.

    Might not be worth it, as everything's moving to .debs soon.

** TODO Plinth [2/7]

*** TODO Integrate Tinc into Plinth [0/1]

**** TODO Tinc Testing

     http://www.vanheusden.com/linux/tinc_mini_howto.html

*** TODO Provide CherryPy through Apache

*** TODO Don't POST password... EVER.

    We currently post on login fails.

*** TODO CherryPy HTTPRedirects Shouldn't Go To 127.0.0.1

    They shouldn't change the server's name.

*** TODO Include missing dependencies. [3/4]
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-07-28 Sun 20:14]

    - [X] psmisc
    - [X] python2.7
    - [X] libpython2.7
    - [ ] sudo

*** DONE Move /build to /vendor
    CLOSED: [2013-07-28 Sun 20:15]
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-07-28 Sun 20:12]

    Do it for consistency with freedombox-privoxy and freedom-maker.

    Update references in:

    - plinth/start.sh
    - plinth/Makefile

*** CANCELED Move ./build dependencies to ../
    CLOSED: [2013-07-28 Sun 14:12]

** TODO Freedom Maker [2/13]

*** TODO Add LDAP Backend

*** TODO Create target specific /etc/network/interfaces

*** TODO Update the login message to mention passwords and intro file.

*** TODO Write an intro file so users can =less hello=

    This will be the user's crash course to their freedombox.

*** TODO Make Plinth Launch on Startup

    - Make plinth in FM during image build process, or,

    - Build some giant startup script to run Plinth that handles everything:

      - make-ing plinth
      - other requirements

      Plinth's own start.sh should handle its own local installation, nothing
      else.  The big script should probably assume ~/exmachina is available.

*** TODO Add tcp tracker

    #+begin_ascii
      The tracker URL in the torrent file uses UDP, which is not universally
      supported in Debian (bug #638194).
    #+end_ascii

*** TODO Add RaspberryPi target

      - [[https://github.com/asb/spindle][Spindle]] :: spindle is a set of scripts to aid building and working on a
           distribution image.

           I'm not crazy about this, it downloads blobs like:

           Confusing: both GPL and not-GPL.  The copy of the GPL comes with an
           interesting Linus-disclaimer.  No source available?

***** [2013-07-20 Sat]

      Lost my RPi.  I have the SD card and the power cord, but not the Pi itself.
      This makes testing difficult.  Where the fuck did I put it?  Guess I buy a
      new one?  Will do that tomorrow.

    Not every device supports external storage anyway...  Just use a bigger
    card.

** TODO ExMachina [0/1]

*** TODO Security Audit / Hammer Away at ExMachina

** TODO Documentation [0/1]

*** TODO Write Developer Documentation

    Take the current state of the FBX and write up how to use all the parts
    together.

* FreedomBox 2.0 [0/7]

  Generally Useful, includes service configuration and UI polish.

  Infrastructure packages should be available in Debian Testing.

** TODO Plinth [0/9]

   Integrate more services.

*** TODO Produce Plinth Debian Package

    See freedombox-privoxy's "make_deb.sh".

*** TODO Integrate OONI

*** TODO Integrate Tor

*** TODO Integrate Blog

*** TODO Integrate Wiki

*** TODO Integrate Friendica

*** TODO Integrate FreedomBuddy

*** TODO Add MAC Changer to Plinth

    Bounce any/all active interfaces to come up with new MAC addresses.

    That'd be useful and convenient, but should exclude the data directory.

** TODO FreedomBuddy [0/6]

*** TODO Finish FreedomBuddy UI

    This'll help reduce dependency duplication.

    Might not be worth it, as everything's moving to .debs soon, anyway.

*** TODO Create Debian Package

*** TODO Split Message Parsing per Message Type

    This will allow FBuddy to handle multiple encryption schemes.

*** TODO Split Database Saving/Loading Code into Separate Module

    Move the db code into /src/db/(modulename).py.

    This'll allow us to support multiple database backends that we can
    preferentially check for data.  LDAP first, shelf second, etc.

*** TODO Add LDAP database backend

** TODO FreedomMaker [0/5]

* FreedomBox 3.0 [0/0]

  A generally usable consumer device.

  Viable upgrade paths should exist between 2.0 and 3.0.

* Unscheduled [0/0]

  These todo items aren't currently scheduled for any milestone.

** FreedomMaker

*** TODO Unify VirtualBox and Image Build Systems

    The VBox image and filesystem image have completely separate dependency
    lists.  That is bad.  Both images should pull in the same list of
    dependencies to make sure they're functionally equivalent.

    We'll need to parse the single dependency list for each image separately and
    pass those to the dependency-getter (apt-get in one case, --package in the
    other).  Unifying other pieces is also nice, but this is the most important.

*** TODO Make Freedom Maker Smarter

    Do a better job of abstracting away devices into configuration options.  For
    example, if we're building for a DreamPlug target, we should enable the
    blink-blinkenlights option: the DreamPlug has LEDs we can use to signal to
    the user), but that should be disabled for a RaspberryPi, as that
    functionality isn't available at best (and might cause undefined behavior in
    the Pi at worst).

    Break out devices by type:

    1. DreamPlug v1
    2. RaspberryPi
    3. VirtualBox Image

*** TODO Improve USB Formatting [1/2]

**** CANCELED Add usb formatting to FM's README
     CLOSED: [2013-07-27 Sat 20:31]
     - State "CANCELED"   from "TODO"       [2013-07-27 Sat 20:31] \\
       If parted handles the image, we can simplify formatting a lot.

**** TODO Move from USB image to .img with parted.

     Parted's really useful.  This means we can forego using a USB device and
     not need to mess with /etc/fstab at all.

     [[file:freedom-maker/Makefile::image:%20$(STAMP)-rootfs-$(ARCHITECTURE)][file:freedom-maker/Makefile::image: $(STAMP)-rootfs-$(ARCHITECTURE)]]

* Theory [0/1]

  These items need to be thought about more.

** TODO Think about trust ratings

   Services can announce how much faith they have in each peer for any
   particular purpose.  That'd be neat.

   For example, if a service starts receiving updates from a peer that
   have future time-stamps, it should signal that the peer has a screwy
   clock.
